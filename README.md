I love to learn, teach, and write. Check out my [blog](https://dev.to/hmcodes).\

In between work, and [Sheltah](https://www.sheltah.com), I can't stop working on tools to make my life and the lives of others easier - usually with TypeScript, but I've worked professionally with other languages like Java and C#. Check out some of my pinned side projects.\

You can find me posting cryptic phrases on [twitter](https://x.com/hmcodes).\
